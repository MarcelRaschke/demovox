demovox is a tool to collect signatures for Swiss popular initiatives by offering the visitor a personalized
signature sheet.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can collect signatures for initiatives and referendums.
= Open =
Demovox is the first truly open platform suitable for efficient collection.
= Secure =
Security is of great concern to us. That's why we've added a few power features. The organization that runs the plugin is in control of the data. It is up to them to store the signatures encrypted in the database.
= Fast =
In order to be able to use this plugin even when a lot of people want to sign, we have outsourced the hardest work and made sure that regular tasks are only executed when the load on the server is not too high.
