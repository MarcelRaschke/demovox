Collect signatures for Swiss popular initiatives and referendums.

== Description ==
Collect signatures for Swiss popular initiatives and referendums.
= Open =
Demovox is the first truly open platform suitable for efficient collection.
= Secure =
Security is of great concern to us. The organization that runs the plugin is always the only one in control of the data and it can be stored encrypted in the database.
= Fast =
Allows many people to sign up at the same time, as it avoids high server loads by generating the signature sheet PDFs on the browser instead.
= Packed with features =
* Opt-in check box
* Track signature sheets
* Reminder for unfinished sign ups or missing signature sheets
* Local initiatives (communal and cantonal)
* Four national languages plus english are supported for any frontend text or mail content
* Signature sheets with turned parts by 90째, 180째 and 270째 (for example letter sheets)
* Swiss abroad
* Supports API for address completion and commune identification by a given address (optional)
* Continuous export to REST API of your CRM
* Counts how many signatures a referrer has provided (link the signature page with a "src" param)

== Screenshots ==
1. Example of a demovox installation on the popular initiative [Pr채mien-Entlastungs-Initiative](https://bezahlbare-praemien.ch/), for which the plugin was initially built for
2. demovox installation on the [Initiative pour les glaciers](https://glaciers.pssuisse.ch/) (or [Gletscher-Initiative](https://gletscher.spschweiz.ch/) in german)
